Randomized Quicksort and Hashing with Chaining

Randomized Quicksort:
Code inside RandomizedQuicksort dir.
This code will compare random index element as pivot with the last element as pivot.
This code runs both sort on array of  length 990.
This code compares both sorts performances on: 
  - Randomly generated arrays
  - Already sorted arrays
  - Reverse-sorted arrays
  - Arrays with repeated elements
This code will generate a .png file with graph comparision between both sorts.
To run this code python libs required are:
  - numpy 
  - matplotlib
To run this code with python3. Just click on run button or 'python3 randomized_quicksort.py' on terminal
 
Hashing with Chaining:
Code inside Hashing
This code handles collision by implementing a list for each of the hash table
This code can insert, delete and search in the hash table
To run this code click on run button or 'python3 hashing.py' on terminal
